        SearchMovies has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate
        its firm commitment to privacy. We care about data privacy and security,
        and are committed to protecting your personal information and your right
        to privacy. Privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to the
        site. The following discloses information gathering and dissemination
        practices for this website. This is the privacy policy (“Privacy
        Policy”) (referred to in the following as "SearchMovie," "Site," "we,"

      <p className="container">
        When a visitor comes to the Site to visit, use, or navigate the
        Services, it collects some information to improve the overall quality of
        the online experience, to help diagnose problems with our server, to see
        how often individuals use parts of the Services so we can analyze and
        improve them, and to administer the Web site. This information does not
        reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information).
        We may use this data alone or in aggregate form, as a statistical
        measure, but not in a manner that is intended to identify you
        personally.

        The Site collects device information (including device name, hardware
        model, operating system and version) and usage information (such as the

        logged on from), the city, state and/or zip code associated with your IP
        Address, referral data or URLs (the address of the last URL a user
        visited prior to clicking through to this site), operating system,
        language preferences, country, location. The Site also collects
        information about how and when you use our Services, including your
        access times, browser characteristics or types (e.g., Mozilla's Firefox,
        Google's Chrome, Microsoft's Bing, or other browser on a Macintosh or
        Windows platform, or on a mobile phone) and other technical information.

      <p className="container">
        This Site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and
        alteration of the information under our control. Access to computer data
        and files at the Site are secured by password coding, and are properly
        protected to prevent unauthorized access. We are committed to protecting
        the security of the Site. We use a variety of industry-standard security
        technologies and procedures to help protect against unauthorized access,
        use or disclosure. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the
        information that we collect. Even though we have taken significant steps
        to protect your information, no company, including us, can fully
        eliminate security risks associated with information. We cannot
        guarantee that our security measures will prevent every unauthorized
        attempt to access, use, or disclose your information.

      <h3 className="center"> Cookies Policy</h3>
      <p className="container">
        Our Cookies Policy explains what cookies are, how we use cookies, how
        Third-Parties we may partner with may use cookies on the Service, your
        choices regarding cookies and further information about cookies (often
        referred to as a browser cookie, HTTP cookie, Internet cookie or Web
        cookie). It must be noted that many of the largest and most-visited
        websites use cookies by default, so cookies are everywhere and almost
        unavoidable. Disabling cookies will lock a user out of many of the most
        widely-used sites on the Internet like Youtube, Gmail, Yahoo mail, and
        others. Even search settings require cookies for language settings.
      </p>
      <p className="container">
        Cookies are small pieces of text, often encrypted text files, located or
        stored in browser directories. Cookies are NOT viruses. Cookies use a
        plain text format and contain limited non-personal data, usually a
        unique identifier and the name of the site. They are not compiled pieces
        of code so they cannot be executed nor are they self-executing. Cookies
        cannot contain viruses nor install spyware or malware on your computer.
        Accordingly, they cannot make copies of themselves and spread to other
        networks to execute and replicate again. Since they cannot perform these
        functions, they fall outside the standard virus definition. Cookies are
        created when the user's web browser loads a particular website. A cookie
        is a small file (a small transparent image file or line of code) sent
        from the website's server to your computer whenever you visit. The
        website sends information to your browser which then creates a text
        file. Every time the user returns to the same website, the user's web
        browser retrieves and sends this file to the website's server, to notify
        it of any previous activity you engaged in on the website. Once you
        return to a website, its server can retrieve the cookie file from your
        local computer to assist in expediting certain functions. Most Web
        browsers are set to accept cookies by default. A cookie file allows the
        Service or a Third-party to recognize you and possibly make your next
        visit easier and the Service more useful to you. They are used by web
        developers to help users navigate their websites efficiently and perform
        certain functions. Cookies can be "session" or "persistent" cookies.
        They will either be stored for the duration of your visit (a "session
        cookie") or they will remain on your device for a fixed period, which
        could be months or even years, to remember you across multiple browsing
        sessions (a "persistent cookie"). And cookies can be either "first
        party" or "third party." Cookies may be served to you by the website you
        are visiting (a "first party cookie") or by another organization
        providing services to that website, such as an analytics company or
        advertising network (a "third party cookie").
      </p>
      <p className="container">
        When you use and access the Site and its Services, we may place a small
        number of cookies files in your web browser. Therefore, by using the
        Services, you consent to the use of cookies. We use cookies for the
        following purposes: to enable certain functions of the Service, to
        provide detailed analytics, and to enable advertisements delivery.
        Analytically, it is helpful to know how many users there are, which
        parts of the Site are most popular, which web pages are visited or which
        elements of a page are viewed, and when and for how long. The Site uses
        different kinds of both session and persistent cookies on the Service.
        Advertisements may come from third party companies called "ad networks."
        The Site depends upon advertisers who pay to put their ads on the Site.
        "Ad networks" include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology
        vendors and research firms. If a user views a web page with an ad,
        and/or clicks on an advertisement, the user's web browser requests the
        ad from the ad network's servers, which allows the ad network to view,
        edit or set their own cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, or similar
        tracking tools on the user's browser, just as if the user had visited
        another web page. In the case of advertisements delivery by an ad
        network, the advertiser may use the information (not including your
        name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to
        this Site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services
        that may be of interest to you.
      </p>
      <p className="container">
        Over a period of time, aggregate information of this type can help site
        owners push targeted products or information to the user's browser
        during visits - this can sometimes be helpful, and sometimes not.
        However, at no time does this Site or its service providers attempt to
        identify you individually, nor does this Site create an individual
        profile for the purposes of delivering advertising, or arrange to sell
        personal information about any of its users. These are some common
        examples of the use of cookies: to identify what country or region you
        visited from, the demographics of users, what methods and how a user
        came to visit the Site, including whether the user came directly to the
        Site (by typing in the address) or from another website link, and the
        URL of that website. The Site also tries to identify what browsers are
        used (so we can maximize compatibility), if the user is visiting from a
        search engine such as Google or Bing and what search string was used, or
        whether it was from a bookmark (or favorite).
